## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a full CRUD application to track how much meat a user consumes in a week, for people who want to transition to a healther, more sustainable lifestyle.

For the backend application, I plan to have three models total: user (for authentication), daily_consumption that tracks if the user consumed meat that week, and weekly consumption to track total amount of meat consumed in a week.

## MVP/Post MVP

#### MVP
- Model for daily_consumption
- Model for weekly_consumption
- User model for authentication
- Create: create a user
- Read (show 1): show just daily consumption
- Read (show all): show everyday's consumption and weekly consumption
- Update: update if eaten meat that day and how many servings
- Delete: delete a user's account once logged in 

#### Post MVP
- Add "type_of_meat" for daily consumption
- Make an additional model for carbon-footprint calculation based on the total amount of meat consumed
