## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a full CRUD application to track how much meat a user consumes in a week, for people who want to transition to a healther, more sustainable lifestyle.

For the backend application, I plan to have three models total: user (for authentication), daily_consumption that tracks if the user consumed meat that week, and weekly consumption to track total amount of meat consumed in a week. 


## Time/Priority Matrix

## MVP/Post MVP

#### MVP
- Model for daily_consumption
- Model for weekly_consumption
- User model for authentication
- Create: create a user
- Read (show 1): show just daily consumption
- Read (show all): show everyday's consumption and weekly consumption
- Update: update if eaten meat that day and how many servings
- Delete: delete a user's account once logged in 

#### Post MVP
- Add "type_of_meat" for daily consumption
- Make an additional model for carbon-footprint calculation based on the total amount of meat consumed

## Code Snippets
#### Creating the function that populates the dropdown menu with all the providers
I created a loop within my weekly_consumption model to calculate the total servings each user has per a given week.

```
    def consumption_sum(self):
        days = self.dailyconsumption_set.all()
        counter = 0
        for day in days:
            counter += day.daily_servings
        return counter

    weekly_total = property(fget=consumption_sum)
 ```


## Issues and Resolutions
 
####
Issue: I ran into a roadblock when I wanted to show 1 daily log at a time. This was the first error I got when I tested the route in Postman.
```
TypeError: __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

Resolution: I used retrieve for my show one method. I set queryset equal to the DailyConsumption object.
It first queries through the DailyConsumption table and gets only the entries that have a primary key value (itâ€™s id)
equal to the keyword argument daily_consumption_pk that is grabbed from the endpoint.
```
def retrieve(self, *args, **kwargs):
    queryset = DailyConsumption.objects.get(pk=int(kwargs['pk'][0]))
    results = DailyConsumptionSerializer(queryset)
    return Response(results.data, status=200)
```
